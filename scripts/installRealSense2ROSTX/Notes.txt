Additional Notes:

See: https://github.com/intel-ros/realsense/tree/2.0.3

If you want to edit camera parameters using a GUI and/or use RViz:

$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rviz
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rqt-reconfigure

To adjust camera parameters after the realsense node has been launched:

$ rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure

To start the camera node in ROS, plug in the camera, then type the following command:

$ roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_camera.launch

This will stream all camera sensors and publish on the appropriate ROS topics.

Other stream resolutions and frame rates can optionally be provided as parameters to the 'rs_camera.launch' file.

RGBD Point Cloud

You can start the camera node and make it publish the RGBD point cloud using aligned depth topic.

$ roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_rgbd.launch

Here is an example of how to start the camera node and make it publish the aligned depth stream to other available streams such as color or infra-red.

roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_aligned_depth.launch
